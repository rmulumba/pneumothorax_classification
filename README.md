## Description
   
This is a capstone project for partial fulfillment of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.<br>
The solution will aim to predict the existence of a pneumothorax in a test image using a convolutional neural network and indicate the extent of the condition using binary masks and encode them using RLE.

## Data source
